## Problem Description
In order to monitor and assess our bank’s lending activities and performance, we need to create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio’s health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.

Please check the details of the problems and requirements in the `Problem Statement.docx`.
